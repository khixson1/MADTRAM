        "## MS/MS Adduct Assignment and Spectrum Filter for Machine Learning\n",
        "This script was created and tested in Google's Colaboratory Python environment (https://colab.research.google.com). It takes a single ms/ms text output file obtained from processing a mass spectrometer raw file first through ProteomeWizard's MSConvert(https://proteowizard.sourceforge.io/download.html) software. This script takes MS/MS text results for a single compound/standard and reorganizes it to display binned relative intensities for each mass (range = 50-3500). Pubchem metadata and Classyfire annotations are added by just entry of either the compound name or CAS number. Selected Ions are mapped to possible adduct/ion losses for ions that are 1+, 2+ and 3+. The output is a single row containing over 8000 dimensions of information for each MS/MS scan. Output provides a simple .csv file which can be combined with other output .csv files for other compounds which altogether can be used for subsequent machine learning analysis. A project report is also produced to show Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC), Selected Ion Chromatogram (SIC), prominant ion counts and prominant ion cutoff as well as a summary table showing selected ion masses and adduct matches."

In the provided example a ThermoScientific .RAW file was converted into into a text file using MSConvert centroid peak peaking and charge state correction applied during the RAW-to-text file conversion.\n",

Data scans are further filtered out based on 4 criteria: 1)most prominant ions are determined based on count and scans not containing these ions are removed. 2) m/z that is below a 4+ charge state are removed. 3) if an adduct is not identified for the selected ion m/z, scan is removed, and 4) if the predicted adduct contains atoms that are not in chemical formula of the compound analyzed, the scan is removed.\n",
        "10. Data table representing each ms/ms scan of probable intensities at each m/z value along with corresponding metadata are represented by each row. \n",
        "11. Data table is saved as a .csv file to defined working directory folder.\n",
